# About Me

My name is Jose R Vasquez Perez. I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a Minor on Mathematics on May 2021 from The University of Texas at El Paso. I am always pursuing something new to learn and I am passionate about learning about how the world works. My current interests revolve around Data Science and Operations Research. 


During my free time, I enjoy to travel, eat out and to draw and paint. If anyone is interested in seeing some of my digital art, feel free to visit :
